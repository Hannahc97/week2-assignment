# week2-assignment
This is a walking skeleton for an accessible image gallery.


Reflection
Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

Required
ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?

I tried to implement responsive design using media queries. I was able to get the thumbnail to be resonsive when it's in a mobile layout. However I was having trouble trying to centre it when it was in desktop version. 
I ensured all images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility.
I used event handlers in javascript so that when users click on the thumbnail images they switch.

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
I also was unable to get the large container image to fill the page and be responsive. 

ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
I did find the for loop quite difficult to implement at the start which took quite some time to figure out, however I got there in the end.

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
Please can you advise how you would get the large container image to fill the page and be responsive. Also, how would you centre the thumbnail and be responsive at the same time?

As well how does the reset work? Did I import it correctly, I didn't see a difference?

What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
